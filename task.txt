Please define a new JavaScript object called ‘CityMap’ that can be instantiated with ‘new’,
using its constructor. The constructor takes one parameter as a string - this list of cities and
their latitudes and longitudes:

"Nashville, TN", 36.17, -86.78;
"New York, NY", 40.71, -74.00;
"Atlanta, GA", 33.75, -84.39;
"Denver, CO", 39.74, -104.98;
"Seattle, WA", 47.61, -122.33;
"Los Angeles, CA", 34.05, -118.24;
"Memphis, TN", 35.15, -90.05;

This ‘CityMap’ object should have the following methods:
1) Return the name of the northernmost, easternmost, southernmost or westernmost city
from the list, as requested by the caller.
2) Pass longitude and latitude as parameters, and return the name of the city that is closest
to that location.
3) Return a single string containing just the state abbreviations from the list of cities, each
separated by a space. The method should eliminate duplicate states. The result string
should not have leading or trailing spaces.

-----------------------------------------------

- add an ability to search by states (show list of cities of the state)
- create a tool to add cities with coordinates and states manually on the UI
- add a possibility to save the list of cities in a localStorage and pull it in common list
automatically after page reload
